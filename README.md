# Overview

### [Demo](https://noodlr.netlify.app/)

Noodlr is a React application. The audio logic is driven using [Tone.js](https://tonejs.github.io/). Custom Hooks and a custom Context Provider are used to enforce a clean separation of concerns and modularity of code.

The large Play button's animation and the playful animation on the help widget are both powered using React Spring whereas the smaller grid buttons make use of CSS transitions. The 3D effect on the Play button is created via a number of pseudo elements that are translated based on the main element's state.
